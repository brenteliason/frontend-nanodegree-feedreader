# Project Overview

This project uses Jasmine to automatically test a basic feed reader. The project carries out a total of seven tests organized into four testing suites. To run the tests simply open the "/index.html" file and all the tests should run automatically with the results at the bottom.

The testing ensures that the feed-reader: contains RSS feeds with defined names and URLs, has a menu with visibility that changes on click, loads an initial feed when the page is first opened, and changes content when a different feed is selected.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!
